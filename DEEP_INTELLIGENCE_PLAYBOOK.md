- **Transformation track record**: Did they modernize tech stacks? What tools?
- **Spending authority**: What budgets did they control? ($5M? $50M?)
- **Decision timeline**: How fast do they act? (90-day quick wins vs long-term)

**Research Sources:**
- LinkedIn: Map 3 previous companies
- Crunchbase: Find funding rounds they oversaw
- Press releases: "Under [Name]'s leadership, Company X adopted..."

**Psychology Profile**
- **Risk tolerance**: Do they bet on emerging tech or proven solutions?

- **Vendor loyalty**: Do they bring vendors from previous companies?

**Detection Signals:**
- Conference talks ‚Üí What topics do they champion?
- Twitter/LinkedIn posts ‚Üí What products do they praise?
- Patents filed ‚Üí Technical depth in specific areas

**Network Effects**
- **Warm intro paths**: Who do they know who knows you?

#### üéØ WHY THIS HIRE HAPPENED

**Strategic Context**
- **Company pain point**: What problem is this hire solving?
- **Board pressure**: Were there product delays? Security breaches?
- **Competitive threat**: Did a competitor just launch something?

**Research Approach:**
- Glassdoor reviews from 6 months before hire

- LinkedIn: Track departures in same department (team rebuild?)

**Mandate Detection**

100-day plan signals:

- Tech stack changes (GitHub commits, domain changes)
- Conference appearances (what are they evangelizing?)
- Budget implications: New execs often get $X for "quick wins"

#### üí∞ BUYING WINDOW INTELLIGENCE

**Urgency Factors**

**Optimal Outreach Timing**
- **Week 1-4**: Too early (still learning)
- **Week 5-12**: PERFECT (defining priorities, budget not locked)
- **Week 13+**: Harder (initial vendors already chosen)

#### üìß PERSONALIZATION AMMO

**Email Angles**

## Email Transformation Examples

### Before (Generic)

```
Subject: Helping Seagate with data analytics

Hi Thomas,

I saw you joined Seagate's board. We help companies like yours
with analytics. Would love to chat!

Best,
Sarah
```

### After (Deep Intelligence)

```
Subject: Oracle Cloud playbook for Seagate's storage-as-a-service shift

Hi Thomas,

Congrats on joining Seagate's board! Saw the HAMR launch announcement ‚Äì
scaling from 10 to 500+ customers in 18 months is ambitious.

I worked with your former Oracle Cloud colleague Janet Chen when VMware
faced a similar challenge: operationalizing a new cloud product line
while the sales team grew 3x.

Three things that helped Janet's team:

1. **Automated customer onboarding** (reduced 4-week process to 3 days)
2. **Proactive health scoring** (prevented churn on unproven tech)
3. **Usage analytics** (identified the 2 features that drove 80% of retention)

Given Seagate's $10M integration budget (per Q2 earnings) and the Dec 31
consolidation deadline, I'd love to show you how [Your Product] helped
VMware hit similar timelines.

Worth 15 minutes next Tuesday at 2pm PT?

Best,
Sarah

P.S. Loved your quote in TechCrunch: "Platform consolidation, not point
solutions." That's exactly how we approached the VMware implementation.
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Shows you did your homework (HAMR launch, Oracle background)
- ‚úÖ Mutual connection creates trust (Janet Chen)
- ‚úÖ Specific numbers anchor value (4 weeks ‚Üí 3 days)
- ‚úÖ Addresses their urgent timeline (Dec 31 deadline)
- ‚úÖ Quotes them back to themselves (platform consolidation)
